            Stakeholder satisfaction has always been of prime importance at
            Chitkara University. A clean and well-maintained infrastructure is
            an essential ingredient of a comfortable work and study place.
            State-of-the-art infrastructure of Chitkara University, in a
            built-up area of 1,66,700 m2, spread over seventy seven acres of
            land, needs continuous monitoring and maintenance to always be a
            clean, hygienic and comfortable. Extra care is given to cleanliness
            and maintenance in this campus.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Maintenance of infrastructure is a continuous process, starting from
            the very next day of the creation of infrastructure and which
            increases with time, and needs dedicated attention. With each
            passing day, the need for maintenance increases. Natural causes of
            climate, machines becoming obsolete, routine wear and tear and so on
            - there are various reasons that necessitates constant maintenance
            of infrastructure. Concerns of infrastructure left unresolved or
            delayed, can lead to aggravated complaints, unhygienic work and
            study environments and unsafe infrastructure. It can also lead to
            increased damage and increased cost of repair. Hence the attitude
            adopted towards maintenance is,
            <em> “a stitch in time saves nine”.</em>
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            At Chitkara University, maintenance is handled by dedicated teams.
            Maintenance could be preventive or corrective; could include various
            infrastructural complaints - minor but necessary requirements like
            cleaning windows and drain covers or some more grave situations like
            internal seepages or broken glass windowpane - all concerns are
            taken care of. The teams that dedicatedly ensure these tasks are the
            Administration department and General Maintenance department.
